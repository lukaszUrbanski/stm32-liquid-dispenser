# Automatic Drink Dispenser

An embedded project built on **STM32 Nucleo-F411RE**, designed to control a drink dispensing machine with TFT display, push buttons, rotary encoder, flow sensor, and relay-controlled pump.  
The project starts as a **state machine implementation** and will later be migrated to **FreeRTOS** for multitasking.

## ‚ú® Features

- **320x240 TFT display** for GUI (volume, status, user options).
- **Push buttons** (Start / Stop / Back) for basic control.
- **Rotary encoder** with push button for parameter adjustment.
- **Relay module** to control the water pump.
- **YF-S201 flow sensor** for measuring dispensed volume.
- Configurable **target volume (ml)** with safety **max pour time**.
- Modular code structure with clean separation of:
  - State machine
  - Display driver
  - Input handling
  - Flow measurement
